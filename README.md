# Chexam

## About The Project

Chexam is a combination of two words: Check + Exam. It was developed during the Code-Rally hackathon at <a href="https://estin.dz" target="_blank">ESTIN</a> BÃ©jaia, where my team has won the first place. Chexam is a Web application where teachers can publish copies of exams. It provides students with fast and unlimited access to their scanned copies, allowing them to understand their mistakes.

## Installation
To install and run Chexam on your computer, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:

1. Python 3: You will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer in order to run the application. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Django: Django is a web framework for Python that is used to build the Chexam application. You will need to install Django in order to run the application. You can install Django using the following command:

```
pip install django
```

3. Other dependencies: Chexam also has a number of other dependencies that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the repository. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed all of the necessary software and libraries, you should be able to run the Chexam application by navigating to the root directory of the repository and running the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server, which will host the Chexam application. You can then access the application in your web browser by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>.
